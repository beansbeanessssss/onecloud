The Phoenix Project
-------------------

What is Phoenix?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Phoenix is the Environment for your ownCloud Application frontend. It's completely written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Phoenix's OC Object is a https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js] instance using https://babeljs.io/[babel], https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/[vue-loader], https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource[vue-resource] (and more) bundled with https://webpack.github.io/[Webpack]. UI and theming is based on the http://lesscss.org/[Less] version of https://getuikit.com/[Uikit3] (Currently in beta)

http://requirejs.org/[Require.js] is used in application registration and booting.
