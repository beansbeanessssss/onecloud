Change: Remove opinionated components

BREAKING CHANGE for developers: We've removed the following opinionated components from the ODS and moved them to `web-pkg` instead:

- `OcResource` (now `ResourceListItem`)
- `OcTile` (now `ResourceTile`)
- `OcResourceIcon` (now `ResourceIcon`)
- `OcGhostElement` (now `ResourceGhostElement`)
- `OcResourceLink` (now `ResourceLink`)
- `OcResourceName` (now `ResourceName`)
- `OcResourceSize` (now `ResourceSize`)

Those components hold logic about resources, which is something that is not supposed to live in the ODS. The ODS should only contain design- and layout-specific components.
