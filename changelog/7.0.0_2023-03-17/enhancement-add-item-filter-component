Enhancement: Add `ItemFilter` component

The `ItemFilter` component has been introduced to filter data. It fills the dropdown of `OcFilterChip` with content and can be fed with items, which then can be selected and filtered. The component also supports multi-selection and persists the current selection as route query.
