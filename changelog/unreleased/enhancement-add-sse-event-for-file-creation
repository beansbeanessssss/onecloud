Enhancement: Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for File Creation

We've implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) to notify users in real-time when a file is uploaded,
a new folder is created, or a file is created (e.g., a text file).
With this enhancement, users will see new files automatically appear in another browser tab if they have one open or
when collaborating with others in the same space.
