Change: Theme handling

The handling of themes has been throughoutly reworked.
Themes now feature a human-readable title, can specify whether they are suitable as light or dark mode themes.
If only one theme is provided, this theme will be set.
If two themes are provided and one is a dark and one is a light mode one, there is a light/dark mode switch button in the AppBar.
If more than two themes are provided or the two provided themes are not a dark and a light mode one respectively,
the UI features a theme-switch button featuring a dropdown of the human-readable names of the available themes
