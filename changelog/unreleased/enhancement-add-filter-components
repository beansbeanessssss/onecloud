Enhancement: Add filter components

Two components for filtering data have been added:

* `OcFilterChip` - This component lies in the ODS and holds the basic design of the filter chip.
* `ItemFilter` - This component lies in `web-pkg` and holds the basic implementation of the filter. It fills the dropdown of `OcFilterChip` with content and can be fed with items, which then can be selected and filtered. The component also supports multi-selection and persists the current selection as route query.
