Enhancement: Create shortcuts

We've added a new functionality to add to shortcuts to web, those can be created via the "+ New" context menu.
Users can enter URLs or pick a file via the drop down menu and create a '.url' file.

'.url' files can be opened via web or downloaded and opened on the desktop.
