Enhancement: Add extensionPoint concept

The extension system now allows developers to register extension points. An extension point defines the metadata for the
integration of a certain extension type in a certain context. Examples for extension points are render targets for
custom components, targets for file actions (e.g. the right click context menu, the batch actions, the whitespace context
menu), etc.

Extensions can now specify that they are only valid for a certain or multiple extension points. This way a file action extension
can e.g. specify to be rendered only in the context menu, but not in the batch actions. Consequently, the extension points
concept is the next iteration of the `scopes` concept. The `scopes` concept will most likely be removed in a future release.

Extension points can define if users should be able to choose preferences for the extension point. E.g. for the global progress
bar extension point, users can choose which of the available progress bar extensions should be used, since the extension point
only allows one extension to be active. At the moment we persist the user choice in the local storage of the browser.
