Enhancement: Space group members

We've added the option to manage and work with space group members.

In detail it contains:
* Permission management for space group members
* Inherit space group permissions to child resources
* Groups appear in the autocomplete list when inviting space members
* Selected groups appear in to be invited list
* Selected groups are part of the share creation request payload
* All group type members of a space are listed in the members section of the space
* All users / groups with the "listGrants" permission can see groups which are invited to a space
* All users / groups who only have access on a share level inside a sub-resource of a space can not see all groups which are regular members of the space
