Bugfix: Access token renewal

Access token renewals had some flaws which have been fixed as follows:
- OAuth2: access token renewal was not working at all, fixed by switching to authorization code flow with PKCE extension
- OpenID Connect: when `offline_access` scope was not requested each token renewal caused a redirect to `/`, which was due to a faulty token update implementation and is fixed.
