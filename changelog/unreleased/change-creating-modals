Change: Creating modals

BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The way how to work with modals has been reworked. Modals can now be registered via the `registerModal` method provided by the `useModals` composable, instead of calling `createModal` or `hideModal` from the store.

For more details on how to use the modal please see the linked PR down below.
