Change: Capability store

BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The capabilities have been moved from vuex store to pinia. We also removed the `use...Capability` composables in favor of the new pinia store composable: `useCapabilityStore`.

Furthermore, the `enabled` callback as well as the `name` callback of the `AppNavigationItem` no longer have the `capabilities` parameter.
