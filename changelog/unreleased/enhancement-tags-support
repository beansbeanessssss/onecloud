Enhancement: Add Tag support

Managing files via tags is now possible in web, the feature is experimental and will be only available through a dedicated experimental web build.
Beside that the web version is experimental, it also needs a special experimental ocis version.

Creating Tags, tagging resources and search for tags now is possible and can be used as an alternative way of working and organizing resources.
