Bugfix: Shares tree loading

We've improved loading of the shares tree:

* It now happens more globally in the sidebar component instead of in each sidebar panel.
* Shares won't be loaded for resources without a path anymore.

These changes massively improve the sidebar performance and fix several issues with (re-)share permissions.
