Enhancement: Multiple sidebar root panels

The right sidebar now supports rendering multiple root panels. Since all panels determine their visibility individually it can happen
that e.g. for a given file type multiple root panels would be available. Previously we only rendered the first one. Now we render all
of them below each other, separated by a fine horizontal line.
