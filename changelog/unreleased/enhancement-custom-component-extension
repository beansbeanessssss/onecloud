Enhancement: Custom component extension type

We've introduced a new extension type `customComponent`. This allows to register a custom component via an extension which
can then be rendered in a custom component render target. For the mapping to the render target, an extension point needs to be
registered and a CustomComponentTarget for this extension point needs to be in place in a vue template.
